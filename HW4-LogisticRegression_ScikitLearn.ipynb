There are many websites that offer APIs or searches that allow free downloads of a given time range and location. Select at least one year (maybe more) of recent weather data. A good data set will have things like temperature, barometric pressure, wind speed, etc. And of course, it must have some indication about whether it rained that day, usually in the form of inches of precipitation.\n",
    "- [ ] **Pull this data into your project.** Download the data, and import it into your project as a file. Perhaps using Pandas and import it as a CSV file? You may have to create a new column indicating the label: `0 = no rain, 1 = rain`. This column is an important part of the training process. It’s not a feature, it’s a label for that given vector.\n",
    "- [ ] **Use Logistic Regression.** You’re trying to answer the question, “Is it going to rain today in Boise?” Train a model that tries to predict if it’s going to rain on a given day. The “day” is a vector/row/array/sample of given features that you feed into the model to get a prediction. Remember, you need the same number of features (columns) for a given prediction that you used to train the model.\n",
    "- [ ] **How good is your model?** Is it better than a wild guess? Document your findings in the notebook.\n",
